# Farming Systems Guide

This guide explains the different farming systems supported by the Fish Farm Management System and how to use them effectively.

## Supported Farming Systems

The system supports four types of farming systems, each with different characteristics, requirements, and management practices:

### 1. Super Intensive
- **Description**: Very high stocking density with advanced water treatment and aeration
- **Stocking Density**: 50-100 kg/m³ (Recommended: 75 kg/m³)
- **Feed Conversion Ratio**: 1.2-1.5
- **Water Exchange**: 100-200% daily with advanced filtration
- **Aeration**: Required - High intensity
- **Feed Frequency**: 4-6 times daily
- **Monitoring**: Daily - Multiple times
- **Best For**: Commercial operations with advanced infrastructure, high-value species

### 2. Intensive
- **Description**: High stocking density with regular water management
- **Stocking Density**: 20-50 kg/m³ (Recommended: 35 kg/m³)
- **Feed Conversion Ratio**: 1.3-1.7
- **Water Exchange**: 50-100% daily with basic filtration
- **Aeration**: Required - Moderate intensity
- **Feed Frequency**: 3-4 times daily
- **Monitoring**: Daily
- **Best For**: Commercial farms with good infrastructure, medium to large scale operations

### 3. Semi-Intensive
- **Description**: Moderate stocking density with supplemental feeding
- **Stocking Density**: 5-20 kg/m³ (Recommended: 12 kg/m³)
- **Feed Conversion Ratio**: 1.5-2.0
- **Water Exchange**: 10-30% daily
- **Aeration**: Optional - Low intensity
- **Feed Frequency**: 2-3 times daily
- **Monitoring**: 2-3 times per week
- **Best For**: Small to medium scale operations, most common system

### 4. Extensive
- **Description**: Low stocking density relying on natural food sources
- **Stocking Density**: 0.5-5 kg/m³ (Recommended: 2 kg/m³)
- **Feed Conversion Ratio**: 2.0-3.5
- **Water Exchange**: Natural flow or minimal exchange
- **Aeration**: Not required
- **Feed Frequency**: 1-2 times daily or supplemental
- **Monitoring**: Weekly
- **Best For**: Small scale operations, traditional farming, low-input systems

## Water Quality Parameters

Each farming system has specific water quality requirements:

| Parameter | Super Intensive | Intensive | Semi-Intensive | Extensive |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Dissolved Oxygen | > 6 mg/L | > 5 mg/L | > 4 mg/L | > 3 mg/L |
| Ammonia | < 0.5 mg/L | < 1.0 mg/L | < 2.0 mg/L | < 3.0 mg/L |
| Nitrite | < 0.1 mg/L | < 0.2 mg/L | < 0.5 mg/L | < 1.0 mg/L |
| pH | 7.0 - 8.5 | 6.5 - 8.5 | 6.0 - 8.5 | 6.0 - 9.0 |

## Using Farming Systems in the Application

### Adding a Batch with Farming System

1. Navigate to **Batch Management** from the dashboard
2. Click **"+ Add New Batch"**
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - Batch ID
   - Section
   - Species
   - Quantity
   - **Farming System** (select from dropdown)
   - Start Date (optional)
   - Notes (optional)
4. Click **"Add Batch"**

### Viewing Farming System Information

The farming system is displayed on:
- Batch cards in Batch Management
- Batch reports table
- Filter options in Batch Reports

### Filtering by Farming System

In the **Batch Reports** section:
1. Use the "Farming System" filter dropdown
2. Select a specific system or "All Systems"
3. The report will show only batches matching the selected system

## System-Specific Calculations

The system provides automatic calculations based on the selected farming system:

### Feed Amount Calculation
- Calculates daily, weekly, and monthly feed requirements
- Based on fish quantity, average weight, and system-specific feed conversion ratios
- Adjusts feed percentage based on system intensity

### Stocking Density Calculation
- Compares current stocking density with recommended ranges
- Provides warnings if density is too high or too low
- Helps optimize production capacity

### Growth Rate Estimates
- Provides expected growth rates for each system
- Super intensive: ~2.5g/day
- Intensive: ~2.0g/day
- Semi-intensive: ~1.5g/day
- Extensive: ~0.8g/day

### Production Cost Estimates
- Calculates feed costs
- Includes system-specific additional costs (aeration, water treatment, monitoring)
- Helps with financial planning

## Best Practices

### Super Intensive Systems
- Invest in high-quality filtration systems
- Maintain strict water quality monitoring
- Use premium feed with optimal nutrition
- Implement automated feeding systems
- Regular health checks and disease prevention

### Intensive Systems
- Balance stocking density with water quality
- Regular water testing and treatment
- Quality feed with proper nutrition
- Monitor fish behavior and growth
- Maintain backup systems for aeration

### Semi-Intensive Systems
- Balance natural food with supplemental feeding
- Regular water quality checks
- Monitor pond/tank conditions
- Adjust feeding based on natural food availability
- Seasonal management considerations

### Extensive Systems
- Maximize natural food production
- Minimal intervention approach
- Monitor environmental conditions
- Supplemental feeding during low natural food periods
- Lower operational costs but longer production cycles

## Migration Between Systems

You can change the farming system for a batch if needed:
1. Edit the batch (if edit functionality is available)
2. Or create a new batch with the desired system
3. Consider the implications:
   - Stocking density adjustments
   - Infrastructure requirements
   - Feed and management changes

## Troubleshooting

### High Mortality in Super Intensive
- Check water quality parameters
- Verify aeration is working properly
- Review feed quality and quantity
- Check for disease outbreaks

### Slow Growth in Extensive Systems
- Assess natural food availability
- Consider supplemental feeding
- Check water quality
- Review stocking density

### Water Quality Issues
- Refer to system-specific water quality parameters
- Increase water exchange if needed
- Check filtration systems
- Review feeding practices (overfeeding can degrade water quality)
